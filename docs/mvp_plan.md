## MVP Goals

1. Accept user text input and (mocked or real) health data from iOS app
2. Perform emotion classification on the input text
3. Match against user profile and context memory (e.g. recent emotions)
4. Generate a gentle, personalized suggestion using Semantic Kernel and prompt template
5. Return suggestion to frontend and display it
6. Save interaction history to local memory

### Phase 1 Goals (April 12–14)
- [x] Define core API endpoints and prompt templates
- [x] Build FastAPI skeleton with mock tools
- [x] SwiftUI interface with Apple HealthKit fetch logic (mock OK)
- [x] Agent suggests intervention based on emotion + HRV
- [ ] Record simple demo video

### Phase 2 Goals (April 15–21)
- [x] Update dependencies to use latest Semantic Kernel (v1.x+)
- [x] Create user profiles with preferences
- [x] Build memory system for context awareness
- [x] Integrate Semantic Kernel with Memory system
- [ ] Implement real emotion classification using NLP model
- [ ] Improve suggestion generation with richer templates
- [ ] Add proper error handling and edge cases

### Phase 3 Goals (April 22–30)
- [ ] Integrate real HealthKit data
- [ ] Improve UI with emotion history visualization
- [ ] Add notification system for interventions
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanism
- [ ] Performance optimization and testing
- [ ] Database migration for Memory system (optional)

### Completed Milestones

#### Semantic Kernel Integration (April 16)
- [x] Updated dependencies to use Semantic Kernel v1.x+
- [x] Created core service architecture:
  - [x] AIConfig for managing API keys and model settings
  - [x] KernelService for Semantic Kernel operations
  - [x] PromptService for template management
  - [x] LoggingConfig for comprehensive logging
- [x] Refactored AgentKernel to use Semantic Kernel
- [x] Implemented template conversion from Jinja2 to SK format
- [x] Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Created environment variable management through .env

### Next Steps (Current Focus)
1. Implement real emotion classification through Semantic Kernel
2. Enhance prompt templates with more personalization
3. Add comprehensive test suite for Semantic Kernel features
4. Improve error handling for API failures
5. Optimize performance for faster response times

### Future Enhancements
1. Replace JSON memory storage with database integration
2. Create semantic search capabilities for memory retrieval
3. Implement advanced LLM planning and reasoning for interventions
4. Add multi-modal support for image/voice inputs
5. Develop more sophisticated emotion analysis models

### Flow Summary
User input + Health data → Backend `/analyze` → Semantic Kernel agent uses tools → Generates suggestion → iOS displays it → memory.json logs interaction

### Open Questions

1. How should we handle offline mode when backend is unavailable?
2. What's the optimal refresh rate for health data collection?
3. How do we balance proactive notifications vs user privacy?
4. What's the best way to store sensitive health data securely?
5. When should we migrate from local JSON to a proper database?

### Success Metrics

1. User engagement: Average interactions per day
2. Emotional improvement: Positive trend in emotion classification over time
3. Suggestion relevance: User feedback on suggestion quality
4. Technical performance: Response time under 1 second
5. Memory utilization: Effective use of historical context in responses
