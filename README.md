# Emotion Agent Hackathon Project

An AI-powered iOS health companion app that offers emotional support based on real-time physiological data from Apple Watch.

## Overview

Emotion Agent targets women aged 22â€“40 who use Apple Watch. The app analyzes physiological data (heart rate, HRV, sleep, menstrual cycle) alongside text input to provide personalized emotional support and suggestions.

- **Frontend**: iOS app built with Swift/SwiftUI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + Semantic Kernel (v1.x+)
- **Features**: Emotion classification, personalized suggestions, health data integration

## Project Status

ðŸŽ‰ **Latest Update**: Semantic Kernel integration is now complete! This major update provides:

- Enhanced AI orchestration layer
- Standardized prompt management and template system
- Improved error handling and logging
- More flexible architecture for tool integration

See [docs/semantic_kernel_integration.md](docs/semantic_kernel_integration.md) for comprehensive implementation details.

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Configuration

Before running the backend, you need to set up your environment:

1. Copy the template environment file:
   ```
   cp backend/.env.template backend/.env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Quick Start

For your convenience, we've provided scripts to set up and run the backend:

- **On macOS/Linux**: Run `./run_backend.sh` (you may need to add execute permissions with `chmod +x run_backend.sh` first)
- **On Windows**: Run `run_backend.bat` by double-clicking or from the command prompt

These scripts will:
1. Create a virtual environment if needed
2. Install required dependencies
3. Start the backend server

### Manual Backend Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Install Python 3.9+ if not already installed
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### iOS App Setup

1. Open the ios-app directory in Xcode
2. Make sure you have the latest Xcode installed
3. Select a simulator or device (preferably an iPhone)
4. Build and run the application

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, visit http://localhost:8000/docs for the Swagger UI documentation of available endpoints.

## Key Endpoints

- **POST /agent/analyze**: Analyze user text and health data to generate emotional support
- **GET /health/mock_health/{user_id}**: Get mock health data for testing

## Usage Flow

1. User inputs how they're feeling in the iOS app
2. App collects HealthKit data (mocked for now)
3. Data is sent to backend for analysis
4. Backend processes with Semantic Kernel:
   - Classifies emotions in text
   - Retrieves relevant health insights
   - Uses memory for context awareness
   - Generates personalized suggestion
5. Response displayed to user in a friendly UI

## Development Roadmap

See [docs/mvp_plan.md](docs/mvp_plan.md) for the development roadmap and milestone plan.

## Testing

Run the tests with:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```
